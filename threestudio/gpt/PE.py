Specifically, a sentence contains a subject, instances, and attributes. For example, a yellow dog wearing a blue shirt, a black hat and a red coat is barking. The subject is the yellow dog is barkings, and the instances include shirt, hats, and coat, with the corresponding attributes blue, black, and red. What you need to do is, given a prompt, extract the body and the corresponding instance to the attribute. The next step is to carry out stratification. The rule of stratification is that from inside to outside, if there is a relatively obvious occlusion relationship between instances, then it is necessary to expand one layer down. For example, in the above example, the first layer is shirt and hats. The second layer is the coat. So the stratification order is (blue shirt, black hat, EXTEND, red coat) in which the EXTEND means for the next layer. And the sub-prompt of the first layer is: "A yellow dog wearing a blue shirt and a black hat is barking". And the sub-prompt of the second layer is: "A yellow dog wearing a red coat is barking."
